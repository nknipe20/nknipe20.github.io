            <p>The Eras Tour is the ongoing sixth concert tour by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, who described it as a journey through all of her musical "eras". An homage to her albums, the Eras Tour is her most expansive tour yet, with 146 dates across five continents. It is her second all-stadium tour after the 2018 Reputation Stadium Tour.</p>
            <p>Ticket sales for the Eras Tour were handled by various ticketing agencies around the world, such as Ticketmaster, over several dates. Met with unprecedented, record-setting demand, tickets at every venue sold out in hours. Sales faced technical malfunctions in many countries; bulk purchases of tickets by scalpers and bots were reported at numerous venues, resulting in tickets being listed on resale platforms for exorbitant prices. StubHub noted that the Eras Tour ticket sales were "tracking to be the best-selling of any artist [they've] seen".</p>
            <p>The Eras Tour show is over three hours and 15 minutes long, the longest of Swift's career. It consists of 44 songs grouped into 10 acts. Each act is characterized by a specific color scheme, while transitions between acts are facilitated by on-screen interlude visuals and marked by costume changes with negligible intermissions. Swift addresses the crowd throughout the show.</p> 
            <p>The Eras Tour had an impact on the music industry, entertainment and beyond. It was described as one of the most prominent cultural phenomena of the 21st century, generating a level of attention similar to the 1960s' Beatlemania. The tour elevated the economy of its stops by revitalizing local businesses and tourism, attracted large crowds of spectators outside stadiums, dominated news cycles and social media, inspired tributes from governments and organizations, and fueled an increase in public consumption of her discography. Critics often described the Eras Tour as a monocultural event demonstrating Swift's impact on popular culture.</p>
            <p>Swift announced and released various works during the tour: extended editions of Midnights, the re-recorded albums Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version), the music videos for "Karma" and "I Can See You", and "Cruel Summer" as a single. An accompanying concert film, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, is set for theatrical release on October 13, 2023.</p>
